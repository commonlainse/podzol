Visual programming languages have the possibility of being superior on every aspect than normal programming languages.
Parsing wouldn't have to be done everytime, an efficient binary file format that allows for querying or image-based programming could not only allow for less overhead opening projects but could have the possibility of something never done before: Caching compiler optimizations.

In addition to that they can look significantly prettier and more readable.
For example, type inference, something that in regular programming languages would result in more effort reading the code, here it could be solved by as simply rendering the type right next to the variable name.
Or by using an idea inspired by capacitors, that each capacitor has different color stripes depending on their type.

Podzol would assist in understanding source code like no other IDE can.

So far this is a placeholder.
